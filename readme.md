# Configure PD
Launch PD, and check that audo output and MIDI input work. [Here's a short video showing what to do.] (YOUTUBE LINK VID1)

Next download the patches for the study. On this page, find the green "Code" button at the top, click on it and select the last entry, "Download Zip". Once downloaded unzip the folder. 

In the folder you have just unzipped, open file MAINPATCH_study0612.pd, which should open in PD. 

Select your MIDI controller: in the MEDIA menu select MIDI Settings, and under Input Devices, select your desired MIDI controller.

Select your audio interface for hearing the sounds of the patch and for recording your voice: in the MEDIA menu select Audio Setting, and select your input and output devices as desired.

To verify that everything is working, under the MEDIA menu, select Test Audio and MIDI. You should see VU meters moving in response to your voice. On the middle left section ("Output Monitor") you can click on "80" to hear some sound. In the bottom left of the window you should see a button light up when you press a key on your MIDI controller.
